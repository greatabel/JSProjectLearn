You can simplify TopoJSON data using [topojson-simplify](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-simplify/blob/master/README.md)

The best part is that you can use **topojson** & **topojson-simplify** in two different ways:
- preparing your topology data locally by installing these packages with npm and running scripts on your computer
- simplify your topology data on the fly (This way is better for proptyping)
